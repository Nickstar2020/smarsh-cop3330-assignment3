        New file
        create array list
        
        try to scan the input file {
            while there is more words {
                add word to array list
            }

    function that counts the amount of times a number appears(takes in word and the string array) {
        count var
        
        for loop that goes until the end of the array list {
            if the word equals the word in the array list, then ++ the count var
        }
        
        return the count

    function that orders the words from most occurring to least (takes in count, word, and words amount) {
        initial vars (temps)
        
        for loop that loops through all words {
            for loop that loops through all words again {
                if the next word count is smaller than the next{
                    create temps
                    
                    flip the words around in the array
                }
            }
        }
        
        now generate the visuals in graph style
        create string array for graph visuals
        
        loop through all the words {
            loop through how many times that word occured {
                add an "*" to the visual string
            }
        }
        
        now print the sorted graph thingy
        for loop that loops through the amount of words {
            print out word[i] + : + graph visual string[i]
        }
        
    }
    
    function that finds the words (takes all the words){
        initial vars
        
        for loop that loops through all the words (from input) {
            create temp and obtain word
            
            for loop that loops through the created words string 
            (this string is different from the ALLwords string b/c it only contains a single word 1 time) {
                if the temp word is the same as any of the other words, then set "word is there" to true   
            }
            
            if the word isn't in the list, then count how many times it occurs in the array list 
            and also add it to the word string.
            
            set "word is there" boolean back to false and look at next word.
        }
        
        now that we got all the words, now call for function that orders the words from most occurring to least.
    }
    
    main {
        make array list from read file function
        send array list to find the words function
    }
